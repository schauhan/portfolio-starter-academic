I build software products. I like using tech and data to solve people problems. To do this I work with business executives, users, and tech teams. I ask a lot of questions, and then use data to find answers. I also work on business strategy and marketing - basically anything that will make a product successful.

I've been in tech for over 12 years now. At multiple times in my career I've written code, worked on UI, analysed data, and coached scrum teams. Five years back I moved from engineering to product and loved it. Recently I co-founded a fintech company, [Algoniti](https://www.algoniti.com/). 

Other things I do include *attempted* gardening, riding my motorcycle, and discussing geopolitics with friends. I also give people career advice; sometimes it actually helps.

I'm originally from India and live in Austin, TX.
